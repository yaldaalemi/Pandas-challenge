# Pandas Challenge: PyCitySchools

## Project Overview
In this project, I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school and standardized test data for a city's school district. The goal was to assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. The analysis included creating various DataFrames and calculating key metrics for district-wide and school-specific data.

## Data Analysis
The analysis was divided into several sections, each focusing on specific data and calculations.

### District Summary
- Calculated and displayed key metrics for the entire district:
  - Total number of unique schools
  - Total students
  - Total budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage passing math
  - Percentage passing reading
  - Overall passing rate

### School Summary
- Calculated and displayed key metrics for each school:
  - School name
  - School type
  - Total students
  - Total school budget
  - Per student budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage passing math
  - Percentage passing reading
  - Overall passing rate

### Top and Bottom Performing Schools
- Sorted and displayed the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
- Created DataFrames to display average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending
- Grouped schools into spending ranges per student and calculated average scores and passing rates for each range.

### Scores by School Size
- Grouped schools into size categories (small, medium, large) based on total students and calculated average scores and passing rates for each category.

### Scores by School Type
- Grouped schools by school type (charter, district) and calculated average scores and passing rates for each type.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to showcase my Pandas skills by conducting in-depth data analysis on school and test data. The analysis provided valuable insights into district-wide and school-specific performance, allowing for informed decisions regarding budgets and priorities. This project also highlighted the power of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
